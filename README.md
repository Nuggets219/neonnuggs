A custom theme for Everything2, made by yours truly. Mostly.

A (not too heavily modified) version of Dim Jukka Emulation. All props to the creators of that. I mostly just recoloured it.

Note that this theme is decently purple.

Make sure you've got "show the softlink color gradient" set to FALSE in your user settings.

Paste the css into the Style Defacer. It can be found at

/msg me on E2 if there's any problems.

note that currently homenodes are kind of broken right now- the even rows render as white, making itvery hard to read.

A couple nodelets are still fucky- blame that on my photo editor being a free online one that only lets me save three images a day. Can't use anything else, so I'll grin and bear it. They should be all fixed soon!
