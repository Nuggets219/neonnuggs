A custom theme for Everything2, made by yours truly. Mostly.

A (not too heavily modified) version of Dim Jukka Emulation. All props to the creators of that. I mostly just recoloured it.

Note that this theme is decently purple.

Make sure you've got "show the softlink color gradient" set to FALSE in your user settings.

Paste the css into the Style Defacer. It can be found at

/msg me on E2 if there's any problems.
