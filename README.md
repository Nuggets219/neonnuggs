A custom theme for Everything2, made by yours truly. Mostly.

A (not too heavily modified) version of Dim Jukka Emulation. All props to the creators of that. I mostly just recoloured it.

Note that this theme is decently purple.

Make sure you've got "show the softlink color gradient" set to FALSE in your user settings.

Paste the css into the Style Defacer. It can be found at

/msg me on E2 if there's any problems.

note that currently homenodes are kind of broken right now- the even rows render as white, making itvery hard to read.

on top of that, any nodelets with an image in them are brown because, basically, I can't see 
the images I try to import from github to get them to replace the nodelets' title images. All the other ones should be okay, because they just used text. However, things like the Epicenter, Other Users, and Chatbox nodelets are very ugly still in comparison to the rest of the color scheme.
